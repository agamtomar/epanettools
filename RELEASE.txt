1. Update git hub
2. change version in setup.py
3. Github release (web interface)
4. Upload new release to pypi using twine
Download artifacts from the  build (wheels) from appveyor (at present I do this manually) to dist directory
python setup.py register
python setup.py sdist
twine upload dist/<name>
