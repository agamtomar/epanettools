1. Update git hub
2. change version :  bumpversion
bumpversion --current-version x.y.z minor
(where x.y.z is the current version. minor/major/patch)
3. Github release (web interface)
4. Upload new release to pypi using twine
> python setup.py check 
(If there are warnings, check README.rst, CHANGELOG.rst etc - which will be used in long_description on setup.py)
> python setup.py register
(Once appveyor is finished testing open each test in a seperate tab on the browser. 
then download the artifacts (wheels) and move them to ./dist directory)
twine upload dist/<whildcard>
Note: linux wheels and sdist are uploaded by travis automatically (for each release version)
